I am an American currently based in Bangkok, Thailand.

I have always had a fascination with learning about new places and new languages. 
I studied the Chinese language, and moved to China seven years ago.

In China, I worked on a project to build a new pharmaceutical production site. I spent time with colleagues who were dedicated to the software for the new site and machinery within, and I was fascinated.

These colleagues hailed from China and Europe and represented multiple spoken languages and dialects, and yet the lingua franca was the software language.

I was also very impressed to see how great software empowered people to bring to life and efficiently use complex machinery.

Through this I gained a strong appreciation and interest in software languages, and I decided to join the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program.

Iâ€™m very excited to go on this journey at the Flatiron School.
